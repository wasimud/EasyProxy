## 🚀 Quick Start

### 🐳 Docker (Recommended)
The Docker image includes EasyProxy plus integrated CF Turnstile Solver for maximum compatibility. 

To run the container and persist config/recordings on your host machine, mount the `/data` directory:

```bash
docker run -d -p 7860:7860 -v ./data:/data --name EasyProxy ghcr.io/realbestia1/easyproxy:latest
```

### 🐍 Python (Local)

#### Prerequisites (All Platforms)
- **Python 3.11+**
- **Git** (for cloning dependencies)

#### 🪟 Windows Setup
The easiest way to get EasyProxy plus solvers on Windows:
1. Clone the repository and enter the folder.
2. Run **`start_full.bat`**.
*This script automatically handles CF Turnstile Solver, patches, and dependencies.*

#### 🐧 Linux / macOS Setup
1. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
2. **Start EasyProxy**:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
#### 📱 Termux (Android)
EasyProxy plus solvers is fully supported on Android via Termux + Ubuntu proot.

The setup supports proot-distro 5 and earlier releases, and installs Python dependencies in an isolated virtual environment at `/root/EasyProxy/.venv`.

Android users can also install the APK build if they prefer a simpler app-style setup. The APK is convenient, but it is not as complete as the Python/Termux version, so Termux remains the recommended option for full functionality.

For Termux, full functionality requires a 64-bit Android device. On 32-bit devices, some components and solvers may not work.

The setup also installs `wireproxy` (arm64/armv7) and the pinned WARP registration
script inside the Ubuntu guest, so Cloudflare WARP and the NordVPN/custom WireGuard
SOCKS5 tunnels work on Termux too. The first start registers WARP once and saves the
profile in `/data/warp.conf`; `enable_warp` in the Admin Panel only controls routing.

1.  **Install Termux** from [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.termux/) (do NOT use Play Store version).
2.  **Run the One-Shot Setup**:
    ```bash
    curl -fsSL --retry 3 "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/realbestia1/EasyProxy/main/termux_setup.sh?$(date +%s)" | bash
    ```
3.  **Prevent Termux from Sleeping**:
    - **Wake Lock**: Swipe down your notification bar and click **"Acquire wake-lock"** on the Termux notification.
    - **Battery Optimization**: Go to your Phone Settings -> Apps -> Termux -> Battery -> Set to **"Unrestricted"**.
4.  **Commands**:
    - `easyproxy`: Start the full stack.
    - `easyproxy-update`: Update code and dependencies.
    - `easyproxy-stop`: Stop all services.
    - `easyproxy-logs`: Follow the EasyProxy application log (`Ctrl+C` exits without stopping EasyProxy).
    - `easyproxy-logs --termux`: Follow the Termux/screen log.
    - `easyproxy-logs --attach`: Attach to the running screen session (`Ctrl+A`, then `D` to detach).
    - `easyproxy-logs --help`: Show all logging options.

If `easyproxy-update` reports `CANNOT LINK EXECUTABLE "curl"`, repair the
partially upgraded Termux packages first, then retry the update:

```bash
apt update && apt full-upgrade -y
easyproxy-update
```

## 📦 Deployment Options

| Method | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Docker** | Standard `docker build .` uses the single `Dockerfile` with solvers included. |
| **Docker Compose** | Run the complete stack (Proxy + Solvers) with `docker-compose up -d`. |
| **HuggingFace** | Use `Dockerfile-hf` for seamless deployment on HF Spaces. |
| **Termux** | Support for Android via Python. |

## ⚙️ Configuration

Most configuration settings (including Cloudflare WARP, DVR, and Proxy settings) are now managed directly from the **Admin Panel** at `http://localhost:7860/admin`.

Only basic environment variables need to be set in your `.env` file or container settings:

| Variable | Description | Default |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `PORT` | Server port | `7860` |
| `API_PASSWORD` | Password to protect the proxy API and admin panel | `ep` |

### 🛡️ Cloudflare WARP Integration
The Docker image includes a pinned WARP registration script and `wireproxy`, providing a
userspace WireGuard SOCKS5 relay. The generated profile is saved in `/data/warp.conf`
and reused on subsequent starts.
It requires no `NET_ADMIN`, privileged mode, `/dev/net/tun`, kernel module, or
sysctl.

You can enable and configure WARP, customize the excluded domains list, and enter your license key directly from the **Admin Panel**.

### 🧭 NordVPN, custom WireGuard & TorProxy
Besides WARP, EasyProxy can run extra local SOCKS5 proxies:

| Panel | Profile source | Default SOCKS5 endpoint |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `/admin/nordvpn` | NordLynx profile generated from your NordVPN access token and the server you pick | `socks5h://127.0.0.1:1081` |
| `/admin/wireguard` | Any WireGuard profile pasted into the panel | `socks5h://127.0.0.1:1082` |
| `/admin/torproxy` | Tor client managed by EasyProxy | `socks5h://127.0.0.1:9050` |

WARP keeps `127.0.0.1:1080`; each tunnel has its own process, port and log,
so they can run in parallel. Bind addresses are editable in their panels.

Tor is installed in the Docker image and starts only after enabling it from
`/admin/torproxy`. Automatic circuit rotation is disabled as far as Tor allows
(30-day maximum circuit lifetime); use **Request new IP** for manual `NEWNYM`.
An exit can still change after a failure or process restart. The panel includes
start/stop, manual identity change, Tor egress check and logs. Tor is TCP-only
and should normally be used on selected routes rather than as the default for
all streaming traffic.

In the Admin Panel speed test, **Direct** uses Ookla. Every proxy route uses a
real SOCKS5/HTTP proxied TCP throughput test, shows the egress IP, and does not
fall back to the direct connection. Proxy routes run one 10-second download and
one 10-second upload sample.

Reference the endpoint from **Global Proxies**, a **Transport Route** or an extractor
proxy to route EasyProxy traffic through it. TCP only: the SOCKS5 endpoint cannot
carry UDP. A missing `DNS`, `MTU` and `PersistentKeepalive` in a pasted profile is
filled with `1.1.1.1`, `1420` and `25`; IPv6 entries and wg-quick-only directives
(`Table`, `PostUp`, ...) are stripped before the tunnel starts.

### 🧩 VixSrc FlareSolverr
The Docker image also contains FlareSolverr, Chromium, and Xvfb. FlareSolverr is
not started at EasyProxy startup: VixSrc launches it only after detecting a
Cloudflare challenge, passes the currently selected proxy/WARP route, imports
the returned cookies and User-Agent, then terminates the process immediately.
When WARP is active, a missing solver route fails closed instead of using direct.

## 📖 API Usage
For detailed API documentation and testing, use the built-in **Interactive Docs** available at:
- `http://localhost:7860/docs` (Swagger UI)
- `http://localhost:7860/redoc` (ReDoc)

### 📺 Streaming Proxy
Prefix any stream URL with the proxy endpoint to handle headers and DRM.
```
http://localhost:7860/proxy/manifest.m3u8?url=<URL>
```
**Options:**
- `&clearkey=KID:KEY`: Provide keys for DASH streams.
- `&warp=off`: Force the request to bypass the WARP VPN and use the server's real IP (Direct Connection).
- `&h_<Header Name>=<Value>`: Pass custom headers (e.g., `&h_User-Agent=VLC`).

### 🔍 Stream Extractor
Extract direct video links from supported websites.
```
http://localhost:7860/extractor/video?d=<URL>&redirect_stream=true
```
*Tip: Open `http://localhost:7860/extractor` in your browser for a list of all parameters and supported hosts.*

### 📼 DVR & Recordings
Manage your recordings via the `/recordings` web UI or API.
- `/record?url=<URL>&name=<NAME>`: Start recording and watch simultaneously.
- `/api/recordings/start`: Trigger a background recording.
